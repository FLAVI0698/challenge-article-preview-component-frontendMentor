### What I learned

In this project I had some difficulties that taught me many things. The first one was in the JavaScript part, I had difficulty executing a simple code, but trying to solve it.

The second was to maintain the design for both desktop and mobile, but I managed to solve it by researching and trying to find out why the error was occurring, and I managed to execute the project.

with that, besides breaking my head a lot, I was able to learn good and simple ways of executing a project that at first was complicated for me, but later I found it simple.
